The Faces Flow example (checkout module) ORIGINALLY has an issue
when you call a flow from another flow, 
For example, perform below steps:
checkout--> 
submit and complete checkout --> 
join the club (call joinFlow from checkoutFlow)--> 
then, in joinFlow, when you click to exit the join flow, 
you do not return to the return node of joinFlow, but return to the first flow page of checkoutFlow
with a warning message on page:
"Unable to find matching navigation case with from-view-id '/joinFlow/joinFlow2.xhtml' 
for action 'returnFromJoinFlow' with outcome '/faces-flows-example/exitpage'".
<br/>
This is because of the nested faces flows.
<br/>
Generally, 
Quote from the JEE 8 tutorial:
"Flows can be nested, so that if you call one flow from another and then exit the second flow, 
you return to the calling flow rather than to the second flowâ€™s return node."

To the specific example of the "checkout-module", 
Quote from the JEE 8 tutorial:
"Because flows are nested, if you click Exit Flow from a called flow, 
you will return to the first page of the calling flow. 
(You may see a warning, which you can ignore.) 
Click Exit Flow on that page to go to the specified return node."
